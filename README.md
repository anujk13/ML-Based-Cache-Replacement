# 🧠 ML-Based Cache Replacement

This project implements a **Machine Learning–based cache replacement policy** using a **Decision Tree Classifier** to enhance how an operating system manages memory pages.  
Unlike traditional static algorithms like **LRU (Least Recently Used)**, this approach adapts dynamically to changing access patterns, improving overall cache efficiency and reducing page faults.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Modern operating systems use cache replacement algorithms to decide which memory pages to retain or evict.  
However, algorithms such as **LRU** or **FIFO** are predefined and cannot adapt to user behavior or workload variations.

This project introduces an **intelligent ML-driven approach** that learns from real cache access data to predict whether a page is likely to be reused, optimizing memory management and system performance.

## 💡 Why It’s Beneficial

- 🔁 **Adaptive Learning:** Learns from actual access patterns instead of following fixed logic.  
- ⚡ **Higher Efficiency:** Reduces unnecessary page replacements, improving cache hit ratio.  
- 🧠 **Data-Driven Decisions:** Uses kernel-generated data to guide eviction policies.  
- 🔍 **Optimized Resource Use:** Frees cache intelligently while keeping frequently used pages.  

By integrating **machine learning** into the Linux kernel, this system demonstrates how AI can optimize low-level operating system behavior.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Data Logging**  
   - Modified `mm/vmscan.c` in the Linux kernel to log key parameters: reference bit, dirty status, age, and access count.  

2. **Dataset Creation**  
   - Exported these logs to a `.csv` file and labeled each entry as *reused* or *not reused*.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** in Python to predict the likelihood of page reuse.  

4. **Kernel Integration**  
   - Translated the trained model into C logic and embedded it into the kernel’s page replacement function.  

5. **Testing & Evaluation**  
   - Tested the updated kernel on **Ubuntu VirtualBox**, comparing results with LRU in terms of cache hits, page faults, and performance.
