# ML-Based-Cache-Replacement
A machine learningâ€“based cache replacement policy that replaces traditional algorithms like LRU with a dynamic, data-driven approach. It uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on kernel-generated data to predict which memory pages are likely to be reused, reducing page faults and improving overall cache efficiency in Linux.
